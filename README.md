# poorcurses

A cross platform python library to manipulate the console (without curses).  

Ok, this seems to work for me, at least. It was more of a test to learn the basics of python than a serious thing. But if you want to use
it, cool for you.

If you want a more serious cross platform thing go see UniCurses.
